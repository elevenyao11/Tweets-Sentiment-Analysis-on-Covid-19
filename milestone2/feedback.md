# Milestone 2 Feedback:

### Like:
1. You already prototyped some classifiers. 
2. You are trying to collect your inference datasets.  

### Questions:
1. I wonder if you still want to analyze the sentiment towards some topics or products (e.g., mask, vaccine, and travel). Can you get enough data for these analyses? What condition did you use to collect the inference data for these topics?
2. I think you will analyze more periods rather than just one week in the year 2020. Do I understand correctly?
3. In your temporal analysis, will you take any special events (like lockdown) into account? 


### Recommended Next Steps / Direct Feedback:  
1. As we discussed, you should use the official splits of the sentiment analysis dataset from TweetEval. Please rerun the model and report your new results.
2. You should have all the classification models and find the best model by the end of this week.
3. As we discussed, you could collect tweets from some larger regions (like continents) and more time points if you want to get enough inference data. Also, you can filter and crawl tweets more effectively by parallel processing. 
4. If you cannot get 100k tweets per group, you try 10K tweets. 
5. You should apply your best model to the inference data. 
6. You should think about how to present your analysis results. You may do some research on information visualization. In the final paper, you should provide a clear story of your analysis and findings. For the project presentation, you can use some interactive visualization tools.  You can find some ideas about visualization from the projects of [this UBC course](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/courses/547-20/projects.html).
